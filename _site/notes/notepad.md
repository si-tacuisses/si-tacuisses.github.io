Relationship between nationa and global eq
from perspective from paradox nation state

- reason for income gaps
    - mantains borders
    - inhibits free flow 
    - sustaints institutions
    - basis for wealth creation
    - foundatio nfor economic propsperity
- not presenting any ideas to support either interpretation 
- "two handed economists" (on the one hand, on the other hand)

## Quiz: 

> Would you rather be reach in a poor country or poor in a rich country?

defs:

- purchasepower and availability of services and products
- rich: smone top 5% of that country
- poor: bottom 5%
- rich c.: avarage income rank from rich to poorest (top 5%) and vise versa

> Answer: poor in rich country (adjusted for purchasing power)

- rich in p individual 2918
- p in r individual 13,000

income differences in past lower

graph of global inequality: (see ppt)

- between country inequality rises
- within country inequality staied the same


driven by differential growth rate (some faster)
reversal of growrates for rich part and poor parts

LV: Growth speed is it really a proxy for measuring disparities?

## distribution of income levels

two mode distr moved to one mode 

- china driving force (globalization made its growth faster but not a prerequisite)
- this means global middle class grown ("middle class" here not to be misunderstood)

> Why not take globa. one step further. Reduce barriers to international trade, and labour flow. Cross border labour mobility most potent force for global equity

Hard part: Where to stop? (how far to enable free movement)

if free movement then labour in developing countries could earn a multiple of their level.

> compare similar workers and see the income inequality given mobility restrictions

If free movement then conservative estimate on income increase ca 4 times


## distributional ethics of keeping foreign workers out

restrictions are so restrictive 

slaves vote power 3/5 compared to the value we attribute through the restrictive movement policies of 22%

## labour mobility over trade

ousourcing is a version of mibility, which implies that we accept different labour rights to be applied to foreigh workers (see sweatshops , ....)


## how much?

efficacy of institutions could be compromised by the disproportional influx

unmanageable flows

excessive domestic inequality

long run effects of large scale immigration 

public goods required trust, ... can culture impact this trust or even the framework according to which it works.


## notes

> first wave of gloabisation produced global inequality


# conclusion

reasonf or flow free but also reasons for limit

> corner solutions are not "optimal"

> less financial glob, more labour glob

> nation state is not the enemy it is the basis for the creation
