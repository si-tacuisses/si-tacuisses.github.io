I am currently doing my PhD in Economics, Management and Data Science at [IMT Lucca](https://www.imtlucca.it/). My research interests are among (a lot of) other things Complex Networks, Big Data, Macroeconometrics and Machine Learning. I am passionate about data in all it's forms and constantly looking for curious and ingenious ways to visualize, collect and extract value from data. If any of this sounds interesting to you then be sure to check out some of my posts.
