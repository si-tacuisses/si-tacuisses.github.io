## persistance of inequality over generations


> def: to what extend is is possible for a pereson given a familiy situation to escape said situation

in absence of equal opposrtunities (capabilities Senn) is a prerequisite

secrity of income illustrates that in italy, not only would you not earn as much but also the risk of earning less is proportionally higher

## Def of mobility

Parental education outcomes as a predictor of childs probability of success of sceondary school

increase probability by ca 45% if father had successfully complted secondary education

Proability to graduate given parental education outcome
even higher effect ca. 50%. Confound effect of wealth associated with the a priori higher education 

persistance: earnings as a function of parents earnings
italy, uk and prtugal very high persistance

## "Sources" of social mobility

- equal education opportunities
- access to labour market
- redistribution policies
- weight of family charctersitics



abismal growth reduces the adaptability of the economy (dinamismo economico)
negative labour integration trend over 1995-2013 period.


investment in intangilbe assets (education, intellectual property)



## missing adaptability 


trade-of: inequality-efficiency [false]

LV: Gini -> .... not sufficient interpretation dynamics not showns 

LV: Correlation -> no p-values, ... 

Dataset -> OCSE on wealth distribution [Ask for access]

tax redistribution effect:

- italy not highÂ 
- consider the Pareto distribution argument
- [not well defined index values]
- public spending mostly on renten .... at the cost of the active population:
    - source of gini inequality for income and potential income


poverty in italy not only a result of unemployment, but a result of atypical working relations of young workers (not part of the "core")

uncertain future working relations means that investment in training is not in the interest of the vulnerable employee and the employer, prefrring to invest in long stanging unfirable worker


Family substitutes state support (leads to stay at home until into adult life)

ROI for education in italy among the lowest in the OECD leads to low completion rate of tertiary education

Crisis has exaserbated this in italy oposed to other countries
lower family security in italy means that cost increse to study and thus the opposite effect

NEET increased (Not in education employment or training) in italy much higher than OCSE level.


mismatch of skilled labour and work requirements (max in OCED)


## how to change

- find a more adaptable economic model
    - growth (g) as opposed to (r)
- education most important (reduce drop out rate)
- Mobility -> most important predictor of  -> asili nido -> win-win (donne (up))
- incentivise good educators to go to less prestigious places
- aiuto finanziario di studio e contingente al salario futuro (UK model)
- Matching problem, education reduce disparities given a priori capital access (family fund)
- moral hazar of social welfare is not a very important problem 
- Inharitance tax is very (too) low (especially property i.e. land and real estate)





## op-ed

change in GINI not so strong given its nature and the already high level (signual lelvel)
