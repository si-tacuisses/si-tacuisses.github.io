title: Tutorial - Wolfram Mathematica for Economists - Part 1
---


I am writing a series on how to use [Wolfram Mathematica](http://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/) for economic research, take notes and do exploratory data analysis.
I will focus in the examples on economic applications and some widely used models to illustrated Mathematica's efficiency.


Mathematica is a very powerful and expressive programming language, which I use on a daily basis to do my research. It is unrivalled in Symbolic computation and it is very fast to test ideas, sketch a simple model or review results in journals.
Once you see how powerful this tool is for note taking in maths heavy classes you will appreciate it too.

However, before we dive into some interesting applications of Mathematica, let's get acquainted with he basics.

## First Things First 

Before we start with some economics examples to get acquainted with Mathematica we need to understand the most important parts of the language and how they tie together. We look at how to evaluate expressions and then look at the most important types (i.e. integers, lists). After this me move on to learn how to defined and use basic functions.

### How to evaluate a function

I assume that you have a working copy of Mathematica and know how to open and edit a notebook.
To evaluate a cell/input, press the combinations `Shift`+`Enter` while you have highlighted the cell you want to evaluate. It is customary to start programming in any language with a _Hello World_ example. And here it is.
```Mathematica
In[1]   Print["Hello World!"]
Out[2]  Hello World!
```

### Numbers

Let's look at `Integer`s first. To evaluate the `1+1` press `Shift` and `Enter` and you should get `2`.

```Mathematica
In[1]   1 + 1
Out[2]  2
```

Mathematica avoids conversion of types to more general types whenever possible to avoid any loss of precision (i.e. 1/3 is not transformed from a rational to a real number since this would reduce precision). However if you need a real valued number you can coerce it to a `Real` by either doing an operation with a `Real` or explicitly transform it  using the `N` function.

```Mathematica
In[1]   1 + 1/2
Out[1]  3/2
In[2]   1 + 0.5
Out[2]   1.5
In[3]   N[3/2]
Out[3]  1.5
```

The basic binary operators such as `+` , `-`, `*` and `/` are used just as you use them in any other context, no brackets, braces or other programming syntax is involved.
However if you want to call a function which is not one of these you will need to call them using function syntax. By function syntax I mean to call for example \\(\ln(x)\\) which takes one argument using the Mathematica function `Log[x]`.

```Mathematica
In[1]   Log[1]
Out[1]  0
```

Some things to note here. Official Mathematica functions start with a capital letter and are complete words in the CammelCase style, unlike MATLAB where functions are lower case and excessively shortened. Furthermore unlike MATLAB, Python, R, C/C++ and many other languages the arguments passed to a function are enclosed in square brackets `[ ]`. Parenthesis `( )` are used exclusively for grouping and define the order of operations.

### Lists
Vectors, as you might already know, are simply Lists and in Mathematica vectors are effectively called `List`.  Conversly a matrix is a vector of vectors and as such matrices are implemented in Mathematica as lists of lists.  And higher order structures, say an array with 3 dimensions is a list of lists of lists. I guess you get the point.
A list is a set of Expressions in curly braces `{x1,x2,...,xn}`.
Since it is conceptually equal to a vector in linear algebra you can do the basic operations directly on them. 

```mathematica
In[1]  {1, 2, 3} + {1, 2, 3}
Out[1] {2, 4, 6}
In[2]  2*{1,2,3}
Out[2] {2,4,6}
In[3]  {1, 2, 3}.{1, 2, 3}
Out[3] 14
```

Lists are a central part of Mathematica and a lot of function parameters are supplied as lists.
### Functions
One of the most widely used functional Production Functions is [Cobb-Douglas](en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cobbâ€“Douglas_production_function) \\eqref{eq:1}. Lets look at this omnipresent function.

\\begin{equation}
Y=F(L,K)=A L^\alpha K^\beta
\label{eq:1}
\\end{equation}


Usually in textbook examples it is assumed that the returns to scale
are constant. This means effectively that \\(\beta=1-\alpha\\) and
both are positive. Let's now define this function in Mathematica. A
function in mathematica takes the following form:

```
<FuncName>[var1_,var2_]:= <functionBody>
```

Here `<FuncName>` is the name you assign to the function, then in the square brackets we name the arguments here `var1` and and `var2`. Note the underscore after the variable name. This underscore is necessary as it tells Mathematica "I want to take this and only this argument found here and name it `var`" [^1] . For now just remember that every argument on the lhs of the definition must be defined with an underscore (`_`) after the name and can then be used in the rhs without the underscore.
Then we have the `:=` which effectively means "take the variables on the left and do something on the right", unlike `=` the `:=` operator tells Mathematica to not remember the rhs as is, but to evaluate it every time it is called.
Here we define our function. 

```mathematica
In[1]   CobbDouglas[L_,K_,A_,a_,b_]:=   A * L^a * K^b
In[2]   CobbDouglas[L_,K_,A_,a_]:= CobbDouglas[L,K,A,a,1-a]
```

A lot happened here, so lets look at what we just wrote. We defined a function called `CobbDouglas` on line 1. This function takes 5 arguments and assigns them to the rhs to compute a value. As you can see we have here both `a` and `b` which corresponds to the general case of a cobb douglas.
On line 2 we define the special constant returns to scale variant. Note that we use the same function name `CobbDouglas`  however with only 4 arguments. You can see on the right hand side this is nothing more than to say that if `CobbDouglas`  is called with only 4 arguments we assume that we deal with a constant returns to scale situation. We have given the same name to two different functions varying only on the number (and possibly type) or arguments. [Overloading](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operator_overloading) as it is called is a way to define a function which behaves differently depending on what parameters it obtains.

Now lets move to a more fun application of this function. 
Let's plot the surface of our `CobbDouglas` function for all \\(L\\) and \\(K\\) from 0 to 1, holding \\(A\\) and \\(\alpha\\) fixed at 1 and 0.5 respectively.
We use the build-in [Plot3D](https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Plot3D.html) function to do this.

```Mathematica
Plot3D[ CobbDouglas[l, k, 1, .5], {l, 0, 1}, {k, 0, 1},
    AxesLabel -> {"L","K","Y"}, 
    ColorFunction -> "DarkRainbow",
    MeshFunctions -> {#3 &}]
```

![cobbDouglas]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/cobb_douglas2.png "CobbDouglas")

Now let's look at this plot. We have told `Plot3D` to plot the `CobbDouglas`  function for `l`  from `0` to `1` passing this as a list, where the first element is the variable to which this interval applies. And we do the same thing for `k`. It is also good practice to label the axes and we do that by passing to the `Plot3D` option `AxesLabel` the list of labels to be used `{"L","K","Y"}`. Next we choose a nice `ColorFunction`. This function applies a predefined colour scale to our \\(Y\\) values.
And finally, as good economists we plot some isoquants (i.e. level curves).
Since isoquants are simply the combination of input factors which yield the same output \\(Y\\), we can tell `Plot3D` to place lines (i.e. Mesh) at constant values of \\(Y\\) by passing to the option `MeshFunctions` the pure function `{#3 &}`. I will cover pure functions in one of the next posts on Functional Programming.

## Conclusion
Mathematica has a large community of users writing packages and offering advice on how to solve problems. The best such site is [mathematica.stackexchange.com](htt://http://mathematica.stackexchange.com). If you have a question it has most likely been answered here. And last but not least Mathematica's documentation [online](http://reference.wolfram.com/language/) and offline is superb. Wolfram Mathematica has one of the best documentation I have come across complete of references, neat examples, possible applications and issues.
>Remember: The Documentation is your Friend!

This is just a taste and there is more to come. Stay tuned.
